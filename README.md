# goCon
Produce consumer problem in GO

This is a simple multi-threaded implementation of the Producer consumer problem. This was done in order to explore the golang concurrency features. The problem relies on a simple application of threads(go routines) and mutexes to prevent data races.

The code has a couple of comments and should be fairly easy to understand or replicate.

This is by far not the best implementation of the problem but it helped me to better understand some of golangs, features.
